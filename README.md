## Location based Supermarket CRUD
This is the simplest example of the use of [Laravel](laravel.com) to implement a registration, edition and removal system of supermarket products organised by location.

## Database integration
The database used is [mySql](mysql.com). A single able was used to store products and locations with these properties:
- id
- name
- location
- timestamps (automatically generated by Laravel)

## Models
There is a single model: - Product That holds its objects properties.

## Views
There is a single screens:
- index
from where is possible to make all operations over the system.

## Controllers
There is a single controller: - ProductController that provides methods for CRUDing items
*Here is an extra method to get json data for AJAX calls*

## Routes
The Controller's methods are accessible through its own route - /products and HTTP methods:
- GET
- POST
- DELETE

## Polling
An ajax function is called every 2 seconds to retrieve new items from the database.
